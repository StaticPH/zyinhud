Zyin's HUD
==============
As a mod, Zyin's HUD intends to make your life easier, and improve your Minecraft gameplay experience as a whole. It adds a new HUD, as well as several utility features, some of which are described below.<sup name="marker1">[[1]](#footer1)</sup><br>
Designed with the advanced Minecrafter in mind. 

### Features

A HUD capable of displaying:
- your coordinates
- a compass
- a clock
- ~~potion effect durations~~
- current fps
- the durability of your equipment
- the distance to or coordinates of the block you're looking at
- the distance to nearby players (and optionally, certain other entities)
- ~~showing areas where mobs can spawn~~
- animal info (Currently only supports vanilla animals or entities that extend one of them)

Additionally, it includes a few other utility features, including but not limited to:
- quick deposit
- ~~eating aid~~
- ender pearl aid
- ~~potion aid~~
- torch aid
- weapon swapper
- item selector
- health monitor

All features can be disabled independently, and many include extensive configuration.

This mod _should_ be client-side only. That is, it should do nothing if installed on a server, but should be fully functional<sup name="marker2">[[2]](#footer2)</sup> for a client with the mod installed, both in singleplayer and when connected to a server.
